\f0\fs24 \cf0 My design choices for the low and high fidelity prototype were to create a simple cart that was easy to scan and that affords the user the ability to change any relevant product options. For example, the user can change the color, quantity, or size of any of the items in the cart. I also wanted to separate our similar information into separate sections to make the information easier to read. Lastly, I utilized ample white space and color/type/component consistency to create a minimalistic and aesthetic design. }
